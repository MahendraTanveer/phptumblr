# Warning #
Everything here is pretty old and development has been discontinued a long time ago. It may or may not work with the current Tumblr API, I don't know. Please do not contact me about phpTumblr. You are welcome to "just do what the fuck you want to" with the code (see License), and,to be honest, I'm not interested.

# Quick Documentation #
## Requirements ##
  * PHP5
  * ..? Tell me if it don't work on your environnement :) .

## Learning by example ##
A example.php file is contained in the archive. Just unzip and launch it, this should work like a charm. The code of this example file is documented enough, so you should be able to play with the Tumblr Class after read it. A exemple.cache.php is also in the archive. It explain how to use caching functions.
